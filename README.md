Hello World!

I am a full stack developer from New York City specializing in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and ReactJS. I passed a 15 week software engineering bootcamp at The Flatiron School in 2019. I briefly worked at Revature in Tampa FL studying Java Spring Boot in 2019 as well.  Since then I have been working on personal projects, studying development methodologies, and looking for full-time work as a software engineer. My strengths are that I am a quick learner and an avid fan of programming, so that hard work developing applications feels like play to me. This is why I want to pursue a career in software development. That, and I'm good at it. I'll be happy to prove that for you ;) I was hit particularly hard by Covid-19 in that the time I was supposed to be out networking at Meetups and other dev events was spent in lockdown instead. So getting my career off the ground has been particularly challenging, but I am not giving up. Thank you for reading this far. Have a good day.
